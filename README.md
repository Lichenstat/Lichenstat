A repository consisting of various projects that I take up during my free time. 📚  

If you're here it either means you clicked on the various links I put out over the internet or you found this out of boredom after searching around.👀

Either way thanks for checking the profile out!✨

<!---
Lichenstat/Lichenstat is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
